Abstraction:
> A proposition, property, relation, etc. 
> (Where "etc" means it also includes a 3-ary properties, 4-ary properties, 5-ary properties, and so on)
  
UoD, UofD:
> Universe of Discourse.
> The set of things under discussion at a given time.

DWIM:
> Do What I Mean
> Interpret what I said with the intention I had.
> "To be free to be interpreted in the intended way."

Empty slot:
> An argument to a predicate that is left empty.
> In **mảı jí**, the slot for the beloved has been left empty.

contentive:
> That carries content – predicate, i.e., root word or compound word.

JEO-frame Equivalence:
See [archive](archive), *On frames and signatures*.

frame:
> A family of words, all having the same signature.  
> Each frame is named after a familiar word in the frame.

See [**mı hỏaqgīo**'s list of predicate frames](https://github.com/acotis/serial-predicate-engine/blob/master/code/dict/frame-list.txt) for a list of all major frames.

predicate:
> Verb – a word that relates a number of arguments.

Proposition:
> A statement without ja (the lambda quantifier)

property:
> For example, the sentence "chu?q ja do/ ma/oja-"  
> is like a template statement, with a single hole for a noun.  
> Equivalent to the lambda expression
> > lambda x: x eats the banana
>

Polysemous:
> Of a word, that has more than one meaning.

grammar:
> The rules that parsers use to deconstruct the sentences.
> Different parsers use slightly different grammars, which might result in different parses (although wider discrepancies can be found in semantics).

(The) Lambda quantifier:
> JA. It identifies properties and relations

See *On laughter and the lambda quantifier* in [the archive](archive).

Serialization:
> The rules that govern serial predicates and construction of their expanded forms.

See [Serial predicates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xgt7dPGWSBHx7LTQzl_JqMrti-hgmk1zVA_gCY9TPfM/edit).

signature notation:
> c, 0, 1, … is a notation used to describe the "signature" of a predicate.
> It tells you what kind of thing each place should be filled with, and, more importantly, how it behaves in a serial predicate.
>
> * c = "concrete." "c" doesn't subordinate.
> * 0 = predication (a rising-falling tone (â) phrase, or lû phrase, without the lambda quantifier (ja))
> * 1 = a property (with exactly one ja in it)
> * 2 = a relation (with two ja)
>
> For example, we can describe a predicate like dua as (c 0) –
> the first place is concrete, the second place is a predication.

Template slots:
> Slots in a property, identified by ja (the lambda quantifier)

Transitivity:
See *On Transitive and intransitive verbs* in [the archive](archive)

Number Notation:
> Predicates have arguments, and the arguments can be identified by their position like this:  
> predicate1, predicate2, predicate3  
> for example:  
> > koe1, koe2, koe3, koe4 are the first, second, third, and fouth arguments.
