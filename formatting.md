1. Files cannot be extensionless, because the default extension is `.md`. For structured text, use Markdown files, not plain text.
2. Since <https://uakci.pl/wiki/> is the preferred place to view the wiki (not GitHub), the formatting used here is superior to the one used there.
3. British spelling is preferred.
4. All Toaq phrases should be put in bold markers (`**hỉo ka**`) – even names and single words. They can be written in Vietoaq or verbatim; the text in `**` will be propēly fōmâtêq and cỏvertêq.**
  * Toaq contained within `**` *must* be fūqly tonêq; lìqhtweight-stylêq toaq, such as `dıe jı́ rûqshua`, must be fıêq to hãqe all the tones (**Dien jip rudshuar**). remẻqbē nô to skí the fīst tone whẻ sỉgle words are cıtêq (**ruqshuar**, nô `**ruqshua**`).**
5. Toaqise names. The same rendition of a name should be used across the entirety of a document. Tones are required: `mi Seamtal` **mı sẻaqtāq** is correct; `mi Seaqtaq` isn't.
6. Remember to escape special characters: `^\_^` is a pretty little face ^\_^, but `^_^` will turn on italics.
7. Fancy quotes `“”‘’`, en- and em-dashes – —, and the ellipsis character `…` should always be preferred to straight ASCII quotes `'"`, hyphens `-` (where applicable), and three full stops `...`. Same goes for arrows (`->` → `→`), emotes from Discord (`:t1:` → `◌̄`), subscripts (`₁₂₃`), and others. It's 2019, so Unicode fanciness is always preferred.
8. Edit raw quoted text by these guidelines:
  
  * Edit messages for brevity and clarity.
    - Add the necessary corrections, formatting, and reorderings, but try not to distort the original message and to retain the original formatting as much as possible.
    - If a correction or amendment is made to a previous line by the author of that line, apply it there, *retroactively*.
    - Expand text shortcuts and other ellipticals.
    - Lines such as »thank you«, »I'll write later«, or others that have little to nothing to do with the conversation and aren't essential to it – remove them, perhaps replacing them with `[…]`.
  * Add extra info and corrections in square brackets, like this:
    > This part of the sentence is faithful to the source[, but this part might not be.]
  * In places where the source of a quote might be unclear, be sure to add it.
