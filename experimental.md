Message me (Discord = `@uakci#4467`, email = `ciuak` dot `prog` at `gmail` dot `com`) if you want your (or anybody else's, for that matter) feature on this page, or if you'd like to amend or correct an existing entry, of even if you'd like me to elaborate on a given entry, especially when it's hard to understand.

> <a name="status" href="#status">#</a> A proposal can have one of the following seven status:

* <b>**fı rảı**</b> <a name="firai" href="#firai">#</a> *by* uakci; *status* sidestream (11/2018)
  **fı rảı** (i.e., any of **fı, go, cu, ke,** and then a predicate) attaches a verbal description to a place of the preceding verb (in serials, binds tightly) and removes said place. Example:
  > **chuq**: x1 eats x2.
  > **nuq**: x1 is a snake.
  > **chuq *go* nủq**: x1 eats some snake; (x1 is a snake-eater).
  > **chuq *fı* nủq**: A snake eats x1 [former x2]; x1 is eaten by a snake.

* <b>**mu** (particle)</b> <a name="mu" href="#mu">#</a> *by* la solpa'i; *status* mainstream (2018)
  **mu** is a particle that, followed by a content word, swaps the content word's first and second argument slots. Compare Lojban's *se*.
  *la fagri* is known to be an eager advocate of **mu**, even though the word isn't his (haha, *fagri,* what now?).
  
* <b>**mu** (predicate)</b> <a name="mu2" href="#mu2">#</a> *by* uakci; *status* idiosyncratic (12/2018)
  This is a reiteration of [particle mu](#mu), but without the unneccesary additional syntax.
  [Toadua](https://uakci.pl/toadua/#mpt_56-vw):
  > ▯ is related to ▯ by the reverse of the relation ▯ (binary).
  
* <b>**sa ⊂ raı**</b> <a name="sa" href="#sa">#</a> *by* uakci; *status* idiosyncratic (10/2018)
  Make all **sa** (i.e., **sa, tu, sıa, ja, hı**) members of **raı** – regular predicates. A following restrictive predicate is not mandatory. This saves 50% of your time with the most popular combinations (**sa ráı** → **sá**, **hı ráı** → **hí**). To translate this proposal's **sa** into vanilla Toaq, replace all **sa** with **jeı sa** (and add **raı** at the end if needed). *This also allows one to use **sa** with other tones than the second, e.g., as the predicate **sả sä**, as an adverb **sã**, just like a normal verb. The only drawback is that we're using metapredicates which modify the meaning of the sentence globally (by attaching quantifiers to the front).*

* <b>**meq**</b> <a name="meq" href="#meq">#</a> *by* uakci; *status* draft (11/2018)
  **meq** followed by a predicate (canonically in the sixth tone **ràı**) forms a tag to be put before a noun phrase. This tag describes that, along with the ‘main claim,’ which is the sentence with the tag removed, a ‘side claim’ of the tagged predicate with the x1 filled with the noun phrase and the x2 with the property obtained by replacing the noun phrase in the main claim with a lambda variable holds true. This is perhaps better explained schematically: *`sentence`*… **fı meq ràı hóa** → *`sentence`*… **fı hóa** (main claim) + **rảı hóa lî** *`sentence`*… **fı ja dó** (side claim).
  [Toadua](https://uakci.pl/toadua/#46CV57Aje):
  > pre-prepositional nominaliser: transform the following prepositional phrase into a side statement of the inside noun’s satisfying of property of the containing clause, where the lambda variable is to be placed in the expected position, as if the **meq**-clause were itself one noun (which still participated in the containing clause).

* <b>**doı**</b> <a name="doi" href="#doi">#</a> *by* uakci; *status* sidestream (11/2018)
  [Toadua](https://uakci.pl/toadua/#pTN8Ky42d):
  > pre-predicate particle: forces the meaning of the predicate associated with the highest arity, regardless of the actual number of parameters given. 

* <b>**rảı sa rảı**</b> <a name="sa4" href="#sa4">#</a> *by* Ilmen; *status* idiosyncratic (~06/2018)
  This proposal builds on **sa rảı**, quantification over predicates, which is an official feature. A predicate satisfies the prerequisite posed by **sa rảı** if the predicate in question **raı**-s. (The predicate can have any argument structure). One advantage of this construct is serial predicate incorporability, thus the name.
  Examples by Ilmen:
  > **je sa hảo → je jẻo sa háo**
  > **je sa hảo súq → je jẻo súq sa háo**
  > **je dảı sa hảo súq → je dảı jêo súq sa háo**

* <b>**re**</b> <a name="re" href="#re">#</a> *by* Ilmen *et al.*; *status* unknown (2018)
  **re** represents the logical connective *if and only if* (*iff*, ⇔).
  
* <b>**so**</b> <a name="so" href="#so">#</a> *by* Ilmen; *status* sidestream (2018)
  **so** creates an interjectional (attitudinal) clause that expresses the emotion given by the following predicate. (Grammatical class: **hu**.)

* <b>**huq**</b> <a name="huq" href="#huq">#</a> *by* Ilmen; *status* sidestream (2018)
  The logical connective **huq** ‘ignores’ the clause on the left (the sentence is true if and only if it's true for the right clause). Useful for corrections.

* <b>**ru** scoping</b> <a name="ru-scoping" href="#ru-scoping">#</a> *by* fagri; *status* sidestream (2018)
  As of now, **ru** used in serials expand into two predicates, e.g., **kuaı chủq ra nủo** → **[kuaı chủq] ra [kủaı nủo]** (= **kủaı go lî chủq na ra lî nủo**). *la fagri* proposes that **ru** work on the serial predicate unit level and not expand, i.e., **kuaı [chủq ra nủo]** (= **kủaı go lî chủq ra nủo**).
  
* <b>**poı**</b> <a name="poi" href="#poi">#</a> *by* la solpa'i *et al.*; *status* mainstream (as of Fall 2018, but usage history goes as deep as 10/2017 (!))
  [Toadua](https://uakci.pl/toadua/#EW44Y4NoP) (by *la fagri*):
  > ▯ is a proposition whose x1 participant satisfies property ▯.

  This word has proven to be *extremely* useful when building adverbs and prepositions, e.g. (per *la solpa'i*, 2017-10-10):
  > **pòı jảı** – happily [while being happy]
  > **chủq jí pòı kảqsī múao** – ‘I eat while looking at trees.’

  *la fagri* has recently (27/01/2019) straightened out the definition ([Toadua](https://uakci.pl/toadua/#2487EMdnD)):
  > ▯ is a true proposition whose x1 participant, in participating in the proposition, also does ▯
  
* <b>**peu**</b> <a name="peu" href="#peu">#</a> *by* Ilmen; *status* draft (28/12/2018)
  **peu** is a novel particle for the radix point (`.` as in `123456.789`). If **peu** is used twice, the first one signifies the radix point, but the second one marks the start of the repeating part of a decimal. *From what I assume, the decimal places do not take any magnitude suffixes such as **heı, fue, bıq,** that one would use for the integral part.* Note that if the radix point coincides with the starting point of the repeating part, then **peu** has to be repeated twice – **sıapūı peu peu sảq** for `0.(3)`.

  *To extrapolate away from Ilmen's proposal: if the second **peu** is omitted, we can always put it to the back of the word, i.e. **shı peu gủ** = **shı peu gủ peu** = `0.2` = `0.2000…`. Similarly, if the first **peu** is missing as well, the number can be said to be followed by two implicit **peu**s, i.e. `7` = **dıaı** = **dıaı peu peu** = `7.(0)`.*

* <b>**raı fı rãı**</b> <a name="fi7" href="#fi7">#</a> *by* Ilmen; *status* draft (28/12/2018)
  Attaches a description to the argument place of the predicate the given **fı** corresponds to. Differs from [**fı rảı**](#firai) in that the designated argument place is not removed from the predicate in the process.

* <b>**ràı** with arbitrary terms</b> <a name="rai6term" href="#rai6term">#</a> *by* la fagri; *status* draft (01/2019, first ideas on 30/09/2018)
  Consider the so-far interpretation of **ràı dó** terms:
  > `sentence…` **ràı dó (da)** → **rảı lû** `sentence…` **na dó (da)**

  Currently, the only kind of term that can appear after a **ràı** is an argument phrase (**dó** or **dô**). *la fagri,* though, proposes that all kinds of terms – this includes argument places other than the second (**fı dó**), adverbs, or even subsequent preposition(al phrase)s – be allowed.

  Note that **ràı ràı** and **ràı rãı** would gain somewhat peculiar – nevertheless useful – semantics:
  > `sentence…` **ràı₁ ràı₂… ràıₐ₋₁ rãıₐ** → **rảıₐ râıₐ₋₁… râı₂ râı₁ lû** `sentence…` = `sentence…` **rãıₐ rãıₐ₋₁… rãı₂ rãı₁** (afterthought subordination in reverse order to **rãı**);
  > `sentence…` **ràı₁ ràı₂… ràıₐ₋₁ ràıₐ dó** → **rảıₐ (go) dó râıₐ₋₁… râı₂ râı₁ lû** `sentence…` = `sentence…` **ràıₐ dó rãıₐ₋₁ rãıₐ₋₂… rãı₂ rãı₁** (carrying the **ràıₐ dó** term down the (reversed) **rãı** chain)

  *la fagri* is currently wondering what **ràı fı dó** – with the 1st place marker **fı** specifically – could be taken to mean.

* <b>Number predicate subordination</b> <a name="numberserial" href="#numberserial">#</a> *by* Ilmen; *status* draft (Winter 2018; earliest mention on 23/03/2018)
  *Ilmen* proposes special handling for number predicates in serials.
  
  First, set *Number* (abbreviated as *N*) to be another argument type capable of subordination, like the proposition, property, and relation types (*0, 1, 2,* respectively), but unlike the *Concrete* type (*C*). Usual rules (earliest non-first or first) should be used to determine the subordinating slot. Whenever a number predicate (like **shı** or **bıq**, or an assemblage thereof) follows an *N*-subordinating predicate, the number predicate is assumed to refer to the abstract idea rather than a certain set of given cardinality. Note that a number predicate can never behave like this as the head of a serial predicate.
  
  When two or more number predicates come in sequence, the behaviour is arbitrary – **saq bỉq gủ hẻı shỉ** means 3021 and not 1016, for example. (This is no different from the status quo).

* <b>Cross-sentence prenexing</b> <a name="cross" href="#cross">#</a> *by* Ilmen; *status* draft (03/2018)
  **bı bı** and **bı na**, or some other particles or sequences of particles, are proposed to start and end the ranges of influence of so-called *super prenexes* which can span multiple sentences.

* <b>*Devour*</b> <a name="devour" href="#devour">#</a> *by* uakci; *status* draft (04/02/2019)
  *Devour* is an idea for another type of argument slot (alongside *Concrete, Abstract, [Number](#numberserial)*). In essence, it removes all slots of the subordinated (*devoured*) predicate. There are two somewhat incompatible proposed behaviours for *Devour*: one (hereafter named *Gobble*) considers only the highest arity definition of the predicate, while the other (*Serve*) allows the devourer to decide which arity to consider. (*Serve* essentially implements a quoting mechanism and is thus more versatile, at the cost of being slightly more complex; note that all instances of *Gobble* can be replaced with *Serve* alongside a contract on the devourer's behalf to consider only the highest arity). It's worth noting that the devoured predicate's places are gone forever; it depends on the devourer if any of the devoured predicate's argument places reappear as part of the devourer's definition. Consider the following cobbled-up examples:
  > **sahāo**: ▯/*Serve* is satisfied by at least one sequence of arguments of any length. (*Predicate doesn't let any of the original predicate's places past.*) → **sảhāo jẻo da.** ‘Something is true, or something satisfies some property.’
  >
  > **lıaqjēo**: ▯/*Serve* is satisfied by the sequence ▯/*Concrete*. (*The predicate's argument structure is reused in a non-obvious way – this kind of relation can't be formalised in the frame definition.*)
  >
  > [**mejēo**](https://uakci.pl/toadua/#1I0cRBaCB): ▯/*Serve* is satisfied by the following sequence of arguments. (*Frame:* \[S…\]. *Same comment as above.*)
  >
  > **lıaqdūa**: ▯/*Concrete* knows that the predicate ▯/*Serve* is satisfied by the following sequence of arguments. (*Frame:* \[CS…\]. *Note that the result is variadic – if **lıaqdūa** is served* n *arguments, then exactly* n−1 *are implicitly passed to the embedded predicate.*) → **lỉaqdūa jí ní da.** ‘I know this to be true.’; **lỉaqdūa jí ní hóq da.** ‘I know this to be/do that.’
  >
  > **lıaqchēo**: ▯/*Concrete*'s members satisfy the predicate ▯/*Gobble* in all non-repeating permutations. (Gobble, *because the semantics would have been messy otherwise.*) → **lỉaqchēo kỉe dủa súqjī da.** ‘We thank each other for knowing each other’; ‘For each distinct *A*, *B*, *C* in **súqjī**, *A* thanks *B* for knowing *C.*’

  The idea for *Devour* arose from discussion about the word [**janē**](https://uakci.pl/toadua/#SyvvCRFbE) (▯ is an arity of the predicate ▯; frame would be \[*ND*\]). Some other words that could benefit from a separate *Devour* kind would be **mejēo**, **cuaq** (proposed word for ‘predicate’), and others. Note that *Devour*'s behaviour is meta-semantical, as it requires the devourer to peek into the argument structure(s) of the devoured predicate in a way more intrusive than that of *Abstract*.
  
* <b>Streamlined direct and indirect question construction</b> <a name="mamoq" href="#mamoq">#</a> *by* uakci; *status* draft (15/03/2019)
  Let **ma, hı, co** be LU with meaning: ‘▯ is the indirect question of {question word} {content of the LU-inner predication},’ having **hı** and **co** bind **hoa**, and let **moq** be a ‘question applicator’ which asks (applies) the (otherwise indirect) question that satisfies the main predication at the first place (allowing other question constructions besides the three above to be applied as well). In other words, redefine the three question words as:
  
  > **ma**: ▯ is (the indirect question of) whether the predication is true;
  > **hı**: ▯ is (the indirect question of) what satisfies the predication at **hoa**;
  > **co**: ▯ is (the indirect question of) how many things satisfy the predication at **hoa**.
  
  These changes, at the cost of sentence-initial marking of what was **hı ráı**/**co ráı** before (this strategy can be found in many languages – notably English – but not *all* languages), would allow for the question subject – now **hoa** – to be buried deep in the sentence (in regular Toaq, the **hı**/**co** would be caught by a fifth-tone phrase and form an unwanted indirect question there instead), mimicking **hı ráı pa lủ…** . Furthermore, it would streamline question construction, which is currently very messy and context-dependent in function. Take a look at the following examples:
  
  > **bủ dủa jí *ló* chủq hó.** ‘I don't know *that* he's eating.’ (**lo** used here for symmetry.)
  >
  > **bủ dủa jí *má* chủq hó.** ‘I don't know *if* he's eating.’
  > → ***mả* chủq hó moq.** ‘*Is* he eating?’
  >
  > **bủ dủa jí *hí* chủq hó (*hóa*).** ‘I don't know *what* he's eating.’
  > → ***hỉ* chủq hó (*hóa*) moq.** ‘*What* is he eating?’
  >
  > **bủ dủa jí *có* chủq hó (*hóa*).** ‘I don't know *how many things* he's eating.’
  > → ***cỏ* chủq hó (*hóa*) moq.** ‘*How many things* is he eating?’
  
  This proposal could also be implemented with **ma**, **hı** and **co** as sentence prefixes (just like the current **ma**), but with the last two still binding **hoa**. The only difference would be the tone used for indirect questions (fifth – **hî** – instead of **hí** as above).
  
  (Note: if you want to include both a direct and an indirect question in your sentence at the same time, you'll need to differentiate between the two **hoa**'s. Ideally there would be a separate word for **hı**'s and **co**'s **hoa**, but for now you can use **hoıhōa** (‘outermost **hoa** in the sentence’): **hỉ bủ dủa súq hí pủ tủa mủaq hóa hóıhōa moq** = ‘Who was the one you didn't know who had killed?’.)
